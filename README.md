# DS_Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration: A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly

_**Project**_

**Data extraction:-**
Clone the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.

**Data transformation:-**
Use a scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

**Database insertion:-**
Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

**Dashboard creation:-**
Use the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

**Data retrieval:-**
Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.

**Deployment:-**
Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users.
